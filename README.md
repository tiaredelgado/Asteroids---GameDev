# Asteroids---GameDev
For this game I implemented all of the required components, including player controls, asteriods, and collisions. 
Additionally, I included shooter functionality that will break up large asteriods into smaller ones or completely destroy asteroids that fall outside of a specified range. 
I drew all of the sprites on my laptop, and I've never done pixel art before but it was really fun. I also randomized the size of the asteriods so that there was a range, and I drew the two different asteriod textures. 
I also implemented respawning after each life, and included a grace period so that even if the player respawns right onto an asteriod, the player is immune to them for three seconds after respawning. 
I would like to include more UI things - like a score and life counter, but just could not get to it in time.
